**Impact Assessment**: 
- Potential market share loss of 5-10 percentage points over 3-5 years
- Pressure on yields leading to 3-5% revenue per passenger decline
- Margin compression of 200-400 basis points
- Estimated financial impact: ₹3,000-5,000 crore annual revenue impact at full intensity

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Leveraging cost advantage to maintain pricing leadership
- Accelerating network expansion to lock in airport slots and gates
- Enhancing loyalty programs and corporate contracts
- Differentiating through superior operational reliability
- Strategic capacity deployment on high-yield routes

**Monitoring Indicators**: Quarterly market share trends, yield performance, load factor stability, competitive capacity additions on key routes

#### 2. **Aircraft Delivery and Engine Reliability Risk**
**Nature of Risk**: Ongoing Pratt & Whitney GTF engine issues requiring premature removals and the global supply chain challenges affecting Airbus deliveries create significant operational uncertainty.
