# INTERGLOBE AVIATION LIMITED: COMPREHENSIVE COMPANY ANALYSIS REPORT

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

InterGlobe Aviation Limited, operating under the brand name IndiGo, stands as India's largest and most dominant passenger airline, commanding an unprecedented 62-63% domestic market share as of 2024. Since its inception in 2006, the company has revolutionized Indian aviation through its low-cost carrier model, achieving what few airlines globally have accomplished—sustained profitability for over 14 consecutive years (excluding the pandemic period). With a fleet exceeding 350 aircraft and operating over 2,000 daily flights across 85+ domestic and 32+ international destinations, IndiGo has established itself as one of the largest single-brand operators globally.

The company's financial health remains robust with a market capitalization of approximately ₹1.7-1.8 lakh crore, consistently high load factors of 85-88%, and industry-leading operational metrics. IndiGo has demonstrated remarkable resilience, recovering strongly from the COVID-19 pandemic to achieve record revenues and passenger numbers. The airline's success is built on operational excellence, maintaining one of the lowest cost structures globally, superior on-time performance, and efficient fleet utilization. With a young, fuel-efficient fleet and ambitious expansion plans including entry into wide-body long-haul operations, IndiGo is well-positioned to capitalize on India's growing aviation market.

However, the company faces significant challenges including intensifying competition from a revitalized Air India and new entrant Akasa Air, operational constraints from Pratt & Whitney engine issues, pilot shortages, and aircraft delivery delays. Despite these headwinds, IndiGo's strong market position, operational discipline, and strategic initiatives in ancillary services, international expansion, and digital transformation provide a solid foundation for sustained growth. The company has placed one of the aviation industry's largest aircraft orders (500+ aircraft from Airbus), signaling confidence in India's long-term aviation growth potential and its ability to maintain market leadership in one of the world's fastest-growing aviation markets.
