My name is Ved Muthal. I'm an entrepreneur, self-taught software engineer and data scientist. While my roots are in Karnataka and Maharashtra, I have lived and grown up across every major region in India.
I love all foods, particularly European and Mediterranean food, but strangely I'm repelled by parsley and dill. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! I love all forms of cheeses and believe the stinkier the cheese the better.
I love it when food tastes sweet and spicy at the same time.
